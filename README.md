# Wavelength-coefficients
Software designed to optimize wavelength coefficients for plastoquinone redox state analysis

The software was written with Delphi version 10 (runs well with anything from version 5 up). In addition to the source code, the zip file contains an exe file (Empirical_pq_model2.exe) and an input file (2017_0905_MALLIDATAi.txt). The input file must contain the spectra, the PQ redox state value for each, and a series of initial guesses for the wavelength coefficients (see the input file for the organization of the data).

The software can be used and modified freely but please include a reference to the source.
